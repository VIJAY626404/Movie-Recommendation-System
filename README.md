## Introduction:
The **Movie Recommendation System** is a machine learning project that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. The system uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to provide accurate recommendations.

## Installation:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, etc.

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movierecommendationsystem.git
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage:

### 3. Inputting User Preferences
The system allows you to input user preferences to generate movie recommendations. Follow these steps in the notebook:

1. **Load the Data**: Run the cell that loads the movie dataset.
2. **Provide User Data**: Enter your user ID or create a new user profile by specifying your movie preferences.
   - For example, you might rate several movies that you have watched.

### 4. Generating Recommendations
After providing the necessary inputs, run the subsequent cells to generate movie recommendations.

1. **User-Based Recommendations**: Get recommendations based on similar users' preferences.
2. **Item-Based Recommendations**: Get recommendations based on similar movies.
3. **Content-Based Recommendations**: Get recommendations based on movie metadata and user preferences.

The output will display a list of recommended movies tailored to your input preferences.
